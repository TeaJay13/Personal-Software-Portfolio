# Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to use TypeScript by building a basic CRUD application. It performs create, read, update, and delete operations on a dataset, showcasing TypeScript's strong typing and error handling. My goal was to improve my understanding of TypeScript and how it can enhance code reliability.
