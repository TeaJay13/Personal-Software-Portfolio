# Overview

This project demonstrates a task management application built in C++. My goal was to gain hands-on experience with the languageâ€™s syntax and concepts, such as classes, file handling, encapsulation, and separation of code into header and implementation files. By creating this to-do list manager, I focused on developing skills that are essential for creating more complex software in C++, including object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and modular design.

The software allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. It also saves tasks to a file and loads them when the program starts, enabling persistent data storage. This application demonstrates practical uses of C++ features in a real-world project setting.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

- Add error handling for file operations to improve robustness.
- Implement search and filter functionality for tasks.
- Create a more user-friendly interface with additional options for user customization.
