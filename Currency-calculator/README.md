# Overview

In this project, I aimed to further my learning as a software engineer by building a simple **currency conversion application** using **JavaScript**. The goal was to demonstrate key features of the language, such as DOM manipulation, working with APIs, and creating a node.js server. This project involved fetching real-time currency exchange rates from an API and updating the conversion output in real-time as the user interacts with the interface.

The primary purpose of this software is to solidify my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals by working on a practical and real-world application. It highlights the asynchronous nature of JavaScript with the `fetch` API and showcases how JavaScript can be used to manipulate web page content dynamically.

# Development Environment

I used the following tools and technologies to develop this project:

- **Node.js**: To serve the API and static files locally.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js to set up the server.
- **JavaScript**: The core language used for DOM manipulation, API integration, and user interaction.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the web interface.
- **ExchangeRate-API**: For fetching real-time exchange rates.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My code editor of choice for writing and debugging the project.

# Future Work

Here are a few areas where I plan to improve the project in the future:

- Implement error messages or visual feedback when the API is unavailable or fails to respond.
- Add more robust input validation and feedback for the user, such as handling negative numbers or non-numeric inputs more elegantly.
- Expand the feature set to include historical exchange rates and a graph to visualize currency trends over time.
