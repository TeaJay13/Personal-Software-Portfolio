# Overview

This project is an interactive map application designed to display local landmarks and locations in Idaho Falls. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of geographic information systems (GIS) and interactive mapping while developing user-friendly software.

The map features over 20 notable landmarks, including parks, museums, and other attractions. Users can filter landmarks by type using intuitive buttons, and clicking on a marker displays detailed information about the location, along with an image. The map is centered on Idaho Falls with lanks marks only closeby ensuring the focus remains on the local area.

The purpose of this software is to provide an educational and practical tool for learning GIS concepts, improving JavaScript programming skills, and creating user-focused applications.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used:
- **VS Code**: A robust code editor for writing and testing the application.
- **Live Server Extension**: A development server for real-time updates while editing the project.
- **ArcGIS API for JavaScript**: A library for creating and managing the interactive map.

The programming languages and tools include:
- **HTML**: To structure the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage and interface elements.
- **JavaScript**: To implement map functionality, marker filtering, and interactions.

# Future Work

Here are some improvements and additional features I plan to implement in the future:
* Add dynamic data fetching from a live server or API for real-time updates.
* Implement user location detection to personalize the map experience.
* Allow users to add custom landmarks and save them locally or to a server.
* Enhance the interface with additional filtering options or a search bar.
